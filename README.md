- <b>TabOverSpace</b> is a website that aims at arming the users with the correct resources to help them find their niche in the vast world of coding and help them get better at it step by step by guiding them and helping them to find their weaknesses and work on them.

- As we are progressing towards a completely digital age , coding is a must have skill.

- Talented individuals across the globe, sometimes can have a hard time getting  the right exposure to land their dream job in top IT firms due to factors like their branch , CGPA , their college and several other factors . 

- To practice timed contests the students have to go through a lot of competitive coding websites to find open contests which might or might not be available for them to attempt at their leisure time.

- It is thus difficult and hectic for the IT firms to conduct their placement drives in colleges across India.
